World of Warcraft Lua API to be used with the [Lua IDEA plugin] for [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Based on [Jon S Akhtar API](https://bitbucket.org/sylvanaar2/idlua-sdk-world-of-warcraft/wiki/Home) for his own Lua plugin, modified to work with the [Lua IDEA plugin].

The `wow-api.lua` file is generated by the `get-apis.lua` file, ran using `lua ./get-apis.lua`.

The `wow-widget-api.lua` is not generated yet. I need to find a way to parse [WoWProgramming](http://wowprogramming.com/docs/widgets) to retrieve all the widget's methods with their full signatures.
